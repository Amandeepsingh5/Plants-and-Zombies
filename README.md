Milestone 1: A text-based (i.e., console-based input and textual representation), barebones
but playable version of the game (sunflowers, one other type of plant, one type of
zombie, just one level), UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagrams, sequence
diagrams, complete variable and method signatures), detailed description of the choice of
data structures and relevant operations: you are providing an initial design and
implementation for the Model part of the MVC. Do not worry about any GUI yet.
• Deliverables: readme file (see explanation below) + code + UML diagrams +
documentation, all in one zip file.
• Deadline: Wednesday Oct 29rd. Weight: 15% of the overall project grade.
